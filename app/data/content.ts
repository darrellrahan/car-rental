    question: "How do I find such low rental car prices?",
    answer:
      "Book in advance: Booking your rental car ahead of time can often result in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple companies: Use websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Travelocity to compare prices from multiple rental car companies.
